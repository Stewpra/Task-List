# Task List

## Description

The purpose of the project is to help myself reamin ontop of my coding work. With the dynamic functionality of the site it can allow me to monitor my projects while I work through the coding bootcamp and beyond. 
Puncuality and communication are key pieces to working in a team and I want to be the best team member I can be!

## Usage

This is the app in action. The add task button brings up a modal with a form. After entering the information for your task the submit button is pressed and a card it produced in the to-do section. 
The cards change color based on the time until the due date. If the current date is before the due date the card will remain white. If the current date is the same as the due date the card will be yellow and red for past due. 
When teh task is complete the user can move it into the done section. Here the user has some options they can leave the task their as long as they like to help them feel accomplished but once they feel the need the delete button will remove the card entierly.
The user can also delete the card at any point.
